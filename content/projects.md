My to-do list of projects (not in order nor clickable; just raw text for now).

- [ ] Update this site to make it more simple, customized, and *performant* (yeesh!).
- [ ] More blogs. Next up: CORE-TEMPLES framework.
- [ ] Brag Book: Web app that facilitates recording wins.
- [ ] ACTT: API contract testing tool.
- [ ] Primitive To-Do List: Nifty tool to store & automatically (de)compose to-do list items to different scales.
- [ ] Afro-Metrics: Web report on Black/African institutions and key stats.
- [ ] Doki-tech: Aggregation of technologies and their documentation.
- [ ] Setup: Project that sets up boilerplates across entire stack & overcomes configuration/dependency hell.
