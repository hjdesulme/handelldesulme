I’ve been hesitant to write my first blog post. Partly because I’m not entirely sure what I want to write about. But I figured I would write anyways to overcome that hurdle of analysis paralysis because I’m quite certain that I’ll never know what I want to focus on. I have some inklings, but I’ll never know until I dive in headfirst. I’ve also been hesitant because I have a tendency to take great caution about what it is I put out into the world. I have a strong desire to have integrity, intellectual honesty, unadulterated curiosity, and to do good work that I can be proud of. But that, reasonably so, causes me to examine my intentions. So as a compromise, I decided that I’ll write these very feelings. Because this is where I honestly am at the moment. 

One thing I can say with certainty is that I enjoy learning, growing, and contributing. I never expected to be where I am in life, taking in the good and the not-so-good aspects of it, but it’s much more than I could have ever asked for. I think I’ll spend the rest of this post trying to come up with a plan on how I’ll structure my blog.

I gave this post the subtitle of “Learning in Public” because I’ve heard this touted so many times as a great approach that one should follow for their career. It’s been quite intimidating, or downright terrifying, to me because it requires that I be vulnerable. It puts my thoughts out for public observation and all of my flaws, limitations, and cracks in my armor so-to-speak are put out into the open to be possible objects of people’s scrutiny and judgement. It exposes that I'm not all that smart and may not have much insight to offer. And it removes the safety of obscurity. In other words, it requires a great deal of courage and bravery. It’s “being in the arena” as the TPOT, Twitter-tech-people, like to ironically say so often. (I don’t think I’ll ever call it X.)

But as someone who deeply desires to contribute and bring value to a culture greater than themself, there is no other way forward but to put oneself out there. And I believe that striving to come from a place of truth-seeking is the only way to discover true insights and provide value. If you can’t tell by now, this is very hard for me. It's so hard that I feel like I have no other choice but to write about my fears to feel safe enough to write about technology or whatever intellectually stimulating topic comes to mind beyond this. I sort of have to laugh at myself as this is painfully embarrassing.

I want to believe, though, that my fears are invalid. And that the universe that we occupy can be a kind place. And I’m going to write anyways to test that hypothesis. This will be the first lesson that I learn in public. 

Now that I’ve thought about it, I likely won’t try to plan out my posts. I’ll allow them to come naturally and write as inspiration visits. If a theme emerges, I’ll chase it. But in general, I hope to hold true and aspire to exercise the qualities that I mentioned earlier: that of integrity, intellectual honesty, unadulterated curiosity, and good work.
